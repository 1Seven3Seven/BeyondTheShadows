# WorkingThingsThrough

What do I need to implement?

Well the darkness does not exist.  
I am thinking of a grid where the cells contain a value for brightness or darkness.  
So, we need a grid that spans the size of the map.  
I also need to have the player throw items.  
So some way of handling that is needed as well.  
The items should increase the brightness of the grid cells near it.  
The enemy, if it passes by, should reduce the brightness of the cells.

...

Okay, so now basic potions exist, the shadows exist.  
Next thing I believe would be the moving camera, so it follows the player around.  
After that, then I believe modifying the map file to have enemy spawns and the like.  
Cannot think of much else as of right now.  
Good luck future me.

...

Now we got a camera, and that works nice.  
So, I can get to work on some different things now.  
I would like the potions to work better.  
I want particles, I want the potions to be more than a green circle.  
I want there to be something to show where a potion landed.  
Basically showing the results of throwing the potions.  
I think particles first would be best.
