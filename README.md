# BeyondTheShadows

## Somewhat Important Things

When developing I used python 3.11/3.12 with pygame-ce as the only third party package.  
I used a bunch of typehint-ing features of the newer versions of python, so I do not know the lowest version that will
work.

## Running locally

If you are interested in running locally, then install pygame-ce and run the `Game.py` file.

## Running in the browser

To get it working on the browser I used `pygbag`.  
The command used was `pygbag BeyondTheShadows`.

I suppose I lied about only one third party package...  
Well, it is true if running locally.  
So a half lie.
